Repository Description:

This Solidity smart contract repository is designed for a decentralized platform that empowers artists to mint their digital artwork into non-fungible tokens (NFTs), leveraging the robust ERC-721 or ERC-1155 token standards. It features essential functionalities including NFT minting, ownership transfer, and creator tracking, ensuring that artists retain recognition for their work. Central to the contract is the security measure that allows only the original artists to mint their creations, alongside an innovative royalty mechanism that provides artists with earnings from future sales. Each function within the contract is meticulously documented to elucidate its purpose and interactions, making the codebase accessible for future development and audits. The repository strictly adheres to a specified licensing notice and outlines the Solidity compiler versions compatible for a seamless deployment experience, aiming to foster a secure and artist-centric digital art marketplace.
